Pipecat Flows provides a framework for building structured conversations in your AI applications. It enables you to create both predefined conversation paths and dynamically generated flows while handling the complexities of state management and LLM interactions.

The framework consists of:

- A Python module for building conversation flows with Pipecat
- A visual editor for designing and exporting flow configurations

### When to Use Pipecat Flows

- **Static Flows**: When your conversation structure is known upfront and follows predefined paths. Perfect for customer service scripts, intake forms, or guided experiences.
- **Dynamic Flows**: When conversation paths need to be determined at runtime based on user input, external data, or business logic. Ideal for personalized experiences or complex decision trees.

## Installation

If you're already using Pipecat:

```bash
pip install pipecat-ai-flows
```

If you're starting fresh:

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install pipecat-ai-flows

# Install Pipecat with specific LLM provider options:
pip install "pipecat-ai[daily,openai,deepgram,cartesia]"     # For OpenAI
pip install "pipecat-ai[daily,anthropic,deepgram,cartesia]"  # For Anthropic
pip install "pipecat-ai[daily,google,deepgram,cartesia]"     # For Google
```

## Quick Start

Here's a basic example of setting up a static conversation flow:

```python
from pipecat_flows import FlowManager, FlowsFunctionSchema

# Define a function with FlowsFunctionSchema
collect_name_schema = FlowsFunctionSchema(
    name="collect_name",
    description="Record user's name",
    properties={"name": {"type": "string"}},
    required=["name"],
    handler=collect_name_handler,
    transition_to="next_step"
)

# Initialize flow manager with static configuration
flow_config = {
    "initial_node": "greeting",
    "nodes": {
        "greeting": {
            "role_messages": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Your responses will be converted to audio."
                }
            ],
            "task_messages": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "Start by greeting the user and asking for their name."
                }
            ],
            "functions": [collect_name_schema]
        },
        # Additional nodes...
    }
}

flow_manager = FlowManager(
    task=task,
    llm=llm,
    context_aggregator=context_aggregator,
    tts=tts,
    flow_config=flow_config,
)

@transport.event_handler("on_first_participant_joined")
async def on_first_participant_joined(transport, participant):
    await transport.capture_participant_transcription(participant["id"])
    await flow_manager.initialize()
```

## Core Concepts

### Flow Configuration

Each conversation flow consists of nodes that define the conversation structure. A node includes:

#### Messages

Nodes use two types of messages to control the conversation:

1. **Role Messages**: Define the bot's personality or role (optional)

```python
"role_messages": [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a friendly pizza ordering assistant. Keep responses casual and upbeat."
    }
]
```

2. **Task Messages**: Define what the bot should do in the current node

```python
"task_messages": [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Ask the customer which pizza size they'd like: small, medium, or large."
    }
]
```

Role messages are typically defined in your initial node and inherited by subsequent nodes, while task messages are specific to each node's purpose.

#### Functions

Functions come in two types:

1. **Node Functions**: Execute operations within the current state
2. **Edge Functions**: Create transitions between states

Functions can be defined using either the new `FlowsFunctionSchema` class (recommended) or traditional dictionary format:

```python
# Using FlowsFunctionSchema (recommended)
from pipecat_flows import FlowsFunctionSchema

select_size_schema = FlowsFunctionSchema(
    name="select_size",
    description="Select pizza size",
    properties={"size": {"type": "string", "enum": ["small", "medium", "large"]}},
    required=["size"],
    handler=select_size_handler
)

# Traditional dictionary format
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "select_size",
        "handler": select_size_handler,
        "description": "Select pizza size",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "size": {"type": "string", "enum": ["small", "medium", "large"]}
            }
        },
    }
}
```

Functions behave differently based on their type:

- Node Functions execute their handler and trigger an immediate LLM completion with the result
- Edge Functions execute their handler (if provided) and transition to a new node, with the LLM completion occurring after both the function result and new node's messages are added to context

Functions can:

- Have a handler (for data processing)
- Have a transition_to or transition callback (for state changes)
- Have both (process data and transition)
- Have neither (end node functions)

For Static flows, use `transition_to`:

```python
# Using FlowsFunctionSchema
next_step_schema = FlowsFunctionSchema(
    name="next_step",
    description="Move to next state",
    properties={},
    required=[],
    handler=select_size_handler,  # Optional handler
    transition_to="target_node"   # Specify target node
)

# Using dictionary format
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "next_step",
        "handler": select_size_handler, # Optional handler
        "description": "Move to next state",
        "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}},
        "transition_to": "target_node"  # Required: Specify target node
    }
}
```

For Dynamic flows, use `transition_callback`:

```python
# Using FlowsFunctionSchema
collect_age_schema = FlowsFunctionSchema(
    name="collect_age",
    description="Record user's age",
    properties={"age": {"type": "integer"}},
    required=["age"],
    handler=collect_age,
    transition_callback=handle_age_collection
)

# Using dictionary format
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "collect_age",
        "handler": collect_age,
        "description": "Record user's age",
        "parameters": {...},
        "transition_callback": handle_age_collection  # Specify transition handler
    }
}
```

Pipecat Flows automatically handles format differences between LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini), so you can focus on your conversation logic rather than provider-specific implementations.

#### Actions

There are two types of actions available:

- `pre_actions`: Run before the LLM inference. For long function calls, you can use a pre_action for the TTS to say something, like "Hold on a moment..."
- `post_actions`: Run after the LLM inference. This is handy for actions like ending or transferring a call.

Actions can be registered in two ways:

1. Via handler field in action config:

```python
"pre_actions": [
    # Built-in action (no handler needed)
    {
        "type": "tts_say",
        "text": "Processing your order..."
    },
    # Custom action with handler
    {
        "type": "check_status",
        "handler": check_status_handler
    }
]
```

2. Via manual registration:

```python
flow_manager.register_action("check_status", check_status_handler)
```

Built-in actions (`tts_say`, `end_conversation`) don't require registration.

Example custom action:

```python
async def check_status_handler(action: dict) -> None:
    """Custom action to check system status."""
    logger.info("Checking system status")
    # Perform status check
```

Learn more about built-in actions and defining your own action in the docs.

### Flow Management

The FlowManager handles both static and dynamic flows through a unified interface:

#### Static Flows

```python
# Define flow configuration upfront
flow_config = {
    "initial_node": "greeting",
    "nodes": {
        "greeting": {
            "role_messages": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Your responses will be converted to audio."
                }
            ],
            "task_messages": [
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": "Start by greeting the user and asking for their name."
                }
            ],
            "functions": [{
                "type": "function",
                "function": {
                    "name": "collect_name",
                    "description": "Record user's name",
                    "parameters": {...},
                    "handler": collect_name_handler,     # Specify handler
                    "transition_to": "next_step"         # Specify transition
                }
            }]
        }
    }
}

# Create and initialize the FlowManager
flow_manager = FlowManager(
    task=task,
    llm=llm,
    context_aggregator=context_aggregator,
    tts=tts,
    flow_config=flow_config,
)
await flow_manager.initialize()
```

#### Dynamic Flows

Dynamic flows follow the same pattern as static flows, but use `transition_callback` instead of `transition_to` to specify runtime-determined transitions. Here's an example:

```python
# Define handlers
async def update_coverage(args: FlowArgs, flow_manager: FlowManager) -> FlowResult:
    """Update coverage options; node function without a transition."""
    return {"coverage": args["coverage"]}

# Edge function transition handler
async def handle_age_collection(args: Dict, result: FlowResult, flow_manager: FlowManager):
    """Handle age collection transition; edge function which transitions to the next node."""
    # Use typed result directly
    flow_manager.state["age"] = result.age
    await flow_manager.set_node("next", create_next_node())

# Create nodes
def create_initial_node() -> NodeConfig:
    return {
        "role_messages": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
            }
        ],
        "task_messages": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "Ask the user for their age."
            }
        ],
        "functions": [
            {
                "type": "function",
                "function": {
                    "name": "collect_age",
                    "handler": collect_age,
                    "description": "Record user's age",
                    "parameters": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "age": {"type": "integer"}
                        },
                        "required": ["age"]
                    },
                    "transition_callback": handle_age_collection  # Specify transition handler
                }
            }
        ]
    }

# Initialize flow manager
flow_manager = FlowManager(
    task=task,
    llm=llm,
    context_aggregator=context_aggregator,
    tts=tts,
)
await flow_manager.initialize()

@transport.event_handler("on_first_participant_joined")
async def on_first_participant_joined(transport, participant):
    await transport.capture_participant_transcription(participant["id"])
    await flow_manager.initialize()
    await flow_manager.set_node("initial", create_initial_node())
```

### Context Management

The `FlowManager` provides three strategies for managing conversation context during node transitions:

- **APPEND** (default): Adds new messages to the existing context, maintaining the full conversation history
- **RESET**: Clears the context and starts fresh with the new node's messages, including the previous function call results
- **RESET_WITH_SUMMARY**: Resets the context but includes an AI-generated summary of the previous conversation and the new node's messages

Strategies can be set globally or per-node:

```python
# Global strategy
flow_manager = FlowManager(
    task=task,
    llm=llm,
    context_aggregator=context_aggregator,
    context_strategy=ContextStrategyConfig(
        strategy=ContextStrategy.RESET
    )
)

# Per-node strategy
node_config = {
    "task_messages": [...],
    "functions": [...],
    "context_strategy": ContextStrategyConfig(
        strategy=ContextStrategy.RESET_WITH_SUMMARY,
        summary_prompt="Summarize the key points discussed so far."
    )
}
```

When using `RESET_WITH_SUMMARY`, the system automatically falls back to `RESET` if summary generation fails or times out.

## Examples

The repository includes several complete example implementations in the `examples/` directory.

### Static

In the `examples/static` directory, you'll find these examples:

- `food_ordering.py` - A restaurant order flow demonstrating node and edge functions
- `movie_explorer_openai.py` - Movie information bot demonstrating real API integration with TMDB
- `movie_explorer_anthropic.py` - The same movie information demo adapted for Anthropic's format
- `movie_explorer_gemini.py` - The same movie explorer demo adapted for Google Gemini's format
- `patient_intake_openai.py` - A medical intake system showing complex state management
- `patient_intake_anthropic.py` - The same medical intake demo adapted for Anthropic's format
- `patient_intake_gemini.py` - The same medical intake demo adapted for Gemini's format
- `travel_planner.py` - A vacation planning assistant with parallel paths

### Dynamic

In the `examples/dynamic` directory, you'll find these examples:

- `insurance_anthropic.py` - The same insurance system adapted for Anthropic's format
- `insurance_gemini.py` - The insurance system implemented with Google's format
- `restaurant_reservation.py` - A reservation system with availability checking

Each LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) has slightly different function calling formats, but Pipecat Flows handles these differences internally while maintaining a consistent API for developers.

To run these examples:

1. **Setup Virtual Environment** (recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

## Pipecat Flows Editor

A visual editor for creating and managing Pipecat conversation flows.

![Food ordering flow example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-flows/main/images/food-ordering-flow.png)

### Features

- Visual flow creation and editing
- Import/export of flow configurations
- Support for node and edge functions
- Merge node support for complex flows
- Real-time validation

### Naming Conventions

While the underlying system is flexible with node naming, the editor follows these conventions for clarity:

- **Start Node**: Named after your initial conversation state (e.g., "greeting", "welcome")
- **End Node**: Conventionally named "end" for clarity, though other names are supported
- **Flow Nodes**: Named to reflect their purpose in the conversation (e.g., "get_time", "confirm_order")

These conventions help maintain readable and maintainable flows while preserving technical flexibility.
